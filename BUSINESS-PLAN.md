## üîß Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack (Keep It Simple)
```
Frontend: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL
Authentication: NextAuth.js
Payments: Stripe
APIs: Attom API (property data) + Twilio (SMS)
Hosting: Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend)
Monitoring: Sentry + PostHog
```

### Core Technical Components

#### 1. Property Analysis Engine
```javascript
class PropertyAnalyzer {
  async analyzeProperty(address) {
    // Get property details from Attom API
    const property = await this.attomAPI.getPropertyDetails(address);
    
    // Find comparable sales (last 6 months, 0.5 mile radius)
    const comps = await this.attomAPI.getComparables(address, {
      months: 6,
      radius: 0.5,
      maxResults: 10
    });
    
    // Calculate ARV (After Repair Value)
    const arv = this.calculateARV(property, comps);
    
    // Estimate repair costs (simple algorithm based on age/condition)
    const repairCosts = this.estimateRepairs(property);
    
    // Generate cash offer (70% rule with adjustments)
    const cashOffer = (arv * 0.70) - repairCosts;
    
    return {
      property,
      arv,
      repairCosts,
      cashOffer,
      confidence: this.calculateConfidence(comps.length, property.age)
    };
  }
}
```

#### 2. Lead Management System
```javascript
class LeadManager {
  async createLead(propertyAnalysis, contactInfo, motivation) {
    // Calculate lead score (1-10)
    const leadScore = this.calculateLeadScore({
      propertyValue: propertyAnalysis.arv,
      motivation: motivation,
      timeline: contactInfo.timeline,
      location: propertyAnalysis.property.address
    });
    
    // Create lead record
    const lead = await this.db.leads.create({
      ...propertyAnalysis,
      ...contactInfo,
      leadScore,
      status: 'new',
      assignedTo: this.assignInvestor(propertyAnalysis.property.zip)
    });
    
    // Trigger automated follow-up sequence
    await this.startFollowUpSequence(lead);
    
    // Notify assigned investor
    await this.notifyInvestor(lead);
    
    return lead;
  }
}
```

#### 3. Automated Follow-up System
```javascript
class FollowUpSequence {
  templates = {
    day0: "Hi {name}! Thanks for requesting a cash offer for {address}. {investorName} will review your property and contact you within 24 hours.",
    day1: "Here's how our process works: We buy houses as-is, close in 7-14 days, and handle all paperwork. Questions? Reply STOP to opt out.",
    day3: "Hi {name}, {investorName} here. I'd love to discuss your property at {address}. When's a good time to chat? Call me at {phone}.",
    day7: "Limited time: We can add an extra $2,000 to our offer for a quick 7-day close. Interested? Reply YES for details.",
    day14: "Final follow-up for {address}. If now isn't the right time, we understand. Keep our number for the future: {phone}"
  };
  
  async startSequence(lead) {
    const schedule = [
      { delay: 0, template: 'day0' },
      { delay: 24, template: 'day1' },
      { delay: 72, template: 'day3' },
      { delay: 168, template: 'day7' },
      { delay: 336, template: 'day14' }
    ];
    
    schedule.forEach(step => {
      this.scheduleMessage(lead, step.template, step.delay);
    });
  }
}
```

### Infrastructure Requirements

Database: PostgreSQL (handle 10K+ properties, 1K+ leads)
API Limits: Attom API (1K requests/month starter, scale up)
SMS: Twilio (2K messages/month starter)
Storage: 10GB for property photos and documents
